Cmfive
======

Cmfive is a php framework for creating robust and extensible business applications.

It started as a micro framework which was developed by Carsten Eckelmann in 2007 in Sydney on the bus to work, 
lay dormant for years until it re-emerged as the foundation to the Flow Business System (https://github.com/PyramidPower/flow),
which was developed in house to run a 70 people Solar Installation company.

cmFive grew from the codebase of Flow, but has since then been shaped to be more modern, slimmer and ready to take
on other business applications.
